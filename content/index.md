## What is Hoverfly?

Hoverfly is a lightweight, open source [service virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_virtualization) tool. Using Hoverfly, you can virtualize your application dependencies to create a self-contained development or test environment.

Hoverfly is a proxy written in Go. It can capture HTTP(s) traffic between an application under test and external services, and then replace the external services. It can also generate synthetic responses on the fly.

## Run Hoverfly

To capture traffic between your application and an external service, you will need to configure your OS, browser or application to use Hoverfly as a proxy.

### MacOS and Linux
Run Hoverfly using hoverctl:
```
hoverctl start
```
By default, the Hoverfly proxy runs on localhost:8500. Switch Hoverfly to "capture" mode and make a request with cURL, using Hoverfly as a proxy:
```
hoverctl mode capture
curl --proxy http://localhost:8500 http://hoverfly.io/
```
Hoverfly has captured the request and the response. View the Hoverfly logs:
```
hoverctl logs
```
Switch Hoverfly to "simulate" mode" and make the same request:
```
hoverctl mode simulate
curl --proxy http://localhost:8500 http://hoverfly.io/
```
Hoverfly has returned the captured response.


### Windows
Open a command prompt and run Hoverfly using hoverctl:
```
hoverctl start
```
Configure your application, browser or OS to use the Hoverfly proxy (http://localhost:8500). Switch Hoverfly to "capture" mode:
```
hoverctl mode capture
```
Make some requests from your application, browser or OS, then view the Hoverfly logs:
```
hoverctl logs
```
Switch Hoverfly to "simulate" mode:
```
hoverctl mode simulate
```
Make the same requests from your browser, OS or application. Hoverfly is returning the captured responses.
