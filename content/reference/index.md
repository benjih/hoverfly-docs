## Flags and environment variables

Hoverfly can be configured using flags on startup, or using environment variables.

### Authentication
#### Enable/disable authentication
Flag:

```
-auth <string>
```

Environment variable:

```
export HoverflyAuthEnabled=<string>
```    

Supply `true` to enable authentication. Defaults to `false`.

#### Add a new user
Flags:

```
-add -username <string> -password <string> -admin <string>
```

Supply '-admin false' to make this a non-admin user (defaults to 'true').

For example:

```
./hoverfly -add -username username -password password -admin false   	
```

This creates a new non-admin user with the username 'username' and the password 'password'.

Environment variables:

```
export HoverflyAdmin="username"
export HoverflyAdminPass="password"
```

Setting these environment variables will create a new admin user when Hoverfly starts.

#### Set Hoverfly secret

By default, a random secret is generated every time Hoverfly starts.

Environment variable:

```
export HoverflySecret=<string>
```

#### Set API token expiration (in seconds)
Set to one day by default.

Environment variable:

```
export HoverflyTokenExpiration=<string>

```

### Port selection
#### Set the Admin UI/API port

Defaults to 8888.

Flag:
```
-ap <string>
```

Environment variable:
```
export AdminPort=<string>
```

#### Set the proxy port

Defaults to 8500.

Flag:
```
-pp <string>
```

Environment variable:

```
export ProxyPort=<string>
```

### Mode selection, import & middleware

By default, Hoverfly starts in *simulate mode*.

#### Set capture mode

Flag:

```
-capture
```

#### Set synthesize mode

Requires middleware to be specified.

Flag:
```
-synthesize
```

#### Set modify mode

Requires middleware to be specified.

Flag:

```
-modify
```

#### Specify middleware

Flag:

```

Supply the path to the middleware script.

For example:
```
./hoverfly -synthesize -middleware "scripts/gen_response.py"
```

#### Import service data

Flag:
```
-import <string>
```

Import a service data JSON file from file system or URL. For example:

```
./hoverfly -import http://mypage.com/service_x.json
```

```
./hoverfly -import path/to/my/service_x.json      
```

Environment variable:
```
export HoverflyImport=<string>
```

For example:
```
export HoverflyImport="http://mypage.com/service_x.json"
```

### Webserver

#### Turn Hoverfly into a simulation webserver

Flag:
```

## Hoverctl

Hoverctl is a command line tool bundled with Hoverfly. The purpose of hoverctl is to help in the managing of one or many instances of Hoverfly. Hoverctl does not support all the functionality of Hoverfly yet, but its feature set is growing.

### .hoverfly directory
Hoverctl stores its state in a `.hoverfly` directory. Hoverctl will create this directory in your home folder the first time it needs to save state. This directory is used for the configuration for Hoverfly, the process identifiers and the log files. Hoverctl will always check the working directory before your home directory when looking for the `.hoverfly` directory. This allows for multiple configurations on a per project basis if you require different configurations for Hoverfly.

```sh
.hoverfly/config.yaml
.hoverfly/hoverfly.8888.8500.pid
.hoverfly/hoverfly.8888.8500.log
```

#### Configuration
```
hoverfly.host             #default "localhost"
hoverfly.admin.port       #default "8888"
hoverfly.proxy.port       #default "8500"
hoverfly.username         #default ""
hoverfly.password         #default ""
hoverfly.db.type          #default "memory"
hoverfly.webserver        #default false
hoverfly.tls.certificate" #default ""
hoverfly.tls.key          #default ""
hoverfly.tls.disable      #default false
```

### Pid and log files
For each Hoverfly process created with hoverctl, one file is created to store the process identifier and another for the STDOUT and STDERR of Hoverfly. These files will be named using the hoverfly process with both the admin and proxy ports.

#### Hoverctl commands

#### start
Hoverctl will let you start a Hoverfly process. For this to work, you need to have the Hoverfly binary either in the same directory as hoverctl or have Hoverfly on your $PATH. Hoverctl will start Hoverfly based on the configuration defined in your `config.yaml`. There is no limit to the number of Hoverfly processes you can start. The only requirement is that each Hoverfly process has its own unique admin and proxy ports.
```
hoverctl start
```
Using the global flags, it is possible to override the configuration being set when starting an instance of Hoverfly.
```
hoverctl start --disable-tls
```

By default, hoverctl will start Hoverfly as a proxy. If you wish to start Hoverfly as a webserver instead:
```
hoverctl start webserver
```
#### stop
You can also stop Hoverfly processes using Hoverctl.

    hoverctl stop

The global flags can also be used here. If you have started an instance of Hoverfly on a different admin and proxy port to your config.yaml, you can still stop this by using the flags in combination with the stop command.
```
hoverctl stop --admin-port 1234 --proxy-port 4321
```

#### mode
Using hoverctl, you can find out which mode Hoverfly is running in.

    hoverctl mode

You can also change the mode by specifying the name of mode you want Hoverfly to be in.

    hoverctl mode capture

#### delete
Hoverfly stores internal state while its running. This state is used for testing your application. Using the delete command, you can specify what you want to delete from Hoverfly.

    hoverctl delete simulations
    hoverctl delete delays
    hoverctl delete all

#### export
Instead of having to save the response from the records API endpoint, you can use the export function to save your simulation to disk.

    hoverctl export simulation.json

#### import
Once you have simulations saved, you can import them into Hoverfly using the import function.

    hoverctl import simulations.json

If your simulation file is hosted over HTTP, you can use hoverctl to import it.

    hoverctl import http://example.org/simulation.json

If you have older, v1 simulations, you may still import them using the `v1` flag.

    hoverctl import --v1 old-simulations.json

#### delays
If you want to apply delays to individual hosts in a simulation (to simulate netwrok latency, for example), you can use the `delays` function to supply a JSON file containing the delay configuration or to view delays which have been applied (See **Simulating service latency** in the **Usage** section).

Set delays by supplying JSON file:

    hoverctl delays path/to/my_delays.json

Show delays that have been set:

    hoverctl delays
#### templates
As well importing request/response data using import, you can also import request templates for partial matching to a response using the `templates` function. This function works with a JSON file containing the JSON schema for request templates and responses. (See **Matching requests** in the **Usage** section).

Set templates by supplying JSON file:

    hoverctl templates path/to/my_request_templates.json

Show templates that have been set:

    hoverctl templates

#### middleware
This function is used for getting and setting the middleware being executed by Hoverfly.

To get the middleware currently being used by Hoverfly

    hoverctl middleware

To set the middleware Hoverfly to use

    hoverctl middleware "middleware.sh"

The value given to the middleware function should be a string that contains either a file path, a command a file path or a URL.

#### destination
This command is used for getting and setting the destination being used to determine which requests are being processed by Hoverfly.

To get the destination currently being used by Hoverfly
```
hoverctl destination
```
To set the destination value Hoverfly should use
```
hoverctl destination 'hoverfly.io'
```
The value used should compile to Golang regex. Hoverctl will attempt to compile the expression down and will warn the user if it does not compile.

You can also test your destination value using the `--dry-run` flag. This flag will not set the destination, but instead will test if your regex pattern matches your intended response to record.
```
hoverctl destination '\.io' --dry-run http://hoverfly.io
```
#### config
This command is used for getting the file location of the config.yaml being used. This command will also print the configuration that hoverctl is using.
```
hoverctl config
```

#### logs
Used to get the logs from the instance of Hoverfly started with the hoverctl. This command will return all the logs from when the process was started

    hoverctl logs

If you are trying to debug what is happening and you need to watch the Hoverfly logs, you can use the `--follow` flag to tail the logs and watch them in real time.

    hoverctl logs --follow

### Hoverctl flags

#### --host
This is a global flag that can be used to override the hoverfly.host configuration value from the config.yaml file.

#### --admin-port
This is a global flag that can be used to override the hoverfly.admin.port configuration value from the config.yaml file.

#### --proxy-port
This is a global flag that can be used to override the hoverfly.proxy.port configuration value from the config.yaml file.

#### --certificate
This is a global flag that can be used to override the hoverfly.tls.certificate configuration value from the config.yaml file.

#### --key
This is a global flag that can be used to override the hoverfly.tls.key configuration value from the config.yaml file.

#### --disable-tls
This is a global flag that can be used to override the hoverfly.tls.disable configuration value from the config.yaml file.

#### --verbose
This is a global flag that can be used to get the verbose logs from hoverctl.

#### --version (-v)
This is a global flag that can be used to get the version of hoverctl.
